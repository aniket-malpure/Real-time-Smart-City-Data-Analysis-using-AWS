# Real-time-Smart-City-Data-Analysis-using-AWS
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time data engineering pipeline for a Smart City use case using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS services, and BI tools. The goal is to handle streaming data (vehicle, GPS, camera, weather, emergency) in real time, process it, store it efficiently, and make it available for analytics and visualization.
